## Importance of UX Storytelling
The importance of UX storytelling lies in the ability to put oneself in the shoes of the user. An important step is creating phenotypes of users based on research. By categorizing users and studying them it reveals a lot of important information about user design. Imagining a person's journey not just directly on your site but all the thoughts and emotions leading up to that point is very important to ensure a good user experience. 

## Improved Design Features
Using a hypothetical website is important in this context because I believe a lot of flaws of other vintage resale websites are actually being used to the company's advantage despite being a detriment to user experience. 
1) Having a verification process to ensure items are being properly priced, advertised and cleaned.
2) Prioritizing seller/buyer connections in local areas to mitigate shipping fees and the related environmental impact.
3) Having a mandatory categorization process for each item to ensure it shows up in appropriate searches and filters.
